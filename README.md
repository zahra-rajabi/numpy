# 🧠 NumPy Mastery: Hands-on Practice from Scratch

This repository contains a complete hands-on practice notebook for mastering [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), the foundational library for numerical computing in Python.

## 📌 What's Inside?

- ✅ Arrays creation, reshaping, and data types
- ✅ Indexing, slicing, and boolean masking
- ✅ Broadcasting and dimensional manipulation
- ✅ Sorting, searching, `where`, `nonzero`, `unique`
- ✅ Aggregation functions: `sum`, `mean`, `std`, etc.
- ✅ Advanced indexing, conditional operations
- ✅ Mini-projects and real-world data analysis tasks

## 💻 Format

The notebook is written in clean and organized cells with explanation and outputs. Each section focuses on **concept clarity**, **use cases**, and **interview-level problem-solving**.

## 🚀 Who Is This For?

- Data Science & ML learners
- Python developers transitioning into Data Analysis
- Anyone preparing for technical interviews involving NumPy

## 🛠️ Next Step

This is part of a larger personal roadmap toward mastering:

- NumPy ✅
- Pandas (in progress)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Real-world projects and EDA
